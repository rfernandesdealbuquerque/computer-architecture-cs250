# Project Repository for Computer Architecture course Duke University

## üí† Course

The objective of this course was to learn how computers work (no more magic!), focusing on how the computer hardware executes the software.

## üéì What I learned?

* C programming
* Assembly programming - MIPS assembly language and instruction sets.
* Digital Logic design
* Processor/CPU design
* Memory systems design - caches and virtual memory.
* I/O

## üöÄ Projects

To understand and grasp the concepts well, we developed a total of 5 projects during the course of the semester. 

üí¢ The hwtest.py files for all projects were **NOT** written by me. They were provided by the professor. 

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project 1

* C application that determines the most cost-effective pizza one can order from an input file. 

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Project 2

* Implementation of Project 1 in MIPS Assembly Language. 

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Project 3 

* Finite State Machine designed in Logisim evolution that simulates the starter system for a car's engine. 

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Project 4

* 32-bit MIPS Architecture CPU designed in Logisim evolution - fully working simple computer processor

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Project 5

* C applications that simulate the behavior of write-through Caches and Virtual Memory mapping.
